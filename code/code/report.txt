# Chessboard Diagram Assignment Report

[Replace the square-bracketed text with your own text. *Leave everything else unchanged.* 
Note, the reports are parsed to check word limits, etc. Changing the format may cause 
the parsing to fail.]

## Feature Extraction (Max 200 Words)

[Describe and justify the design of your feature extraction. Note, feature extraction 
includes all the steps that you have taken to produce the 20-dimensional feature vector
starting from the initial image of the puzzle.]

I used Principle Components Analysis to reduce dimensionality, selecting relevant features. Although Linear Discriminant Analysis would have been better suited for this extraction.
My knowledge in PCA offered me leverage in successful feature extraction. PCA can filter out noise from data. The removal of unwanted data prevents overfitting thus giving a higher percentage.

## Square Classifier (Max 200 Words)

[Describe and justify the design of your classifier and any associated classifier training
stage.]

I used k-Nearest Neighbour as my classifier. 

## Full-board Classification (Max 200 Words)

[Describe the approach that you have taken for classifying the full board.]


## Performance

My percentage correctness scores (to 1 decimal place) for the development data are as follows.

High quality data:

- Percentage Squares Correct: [Insert percentage here, e.g. 98.1% - remove brackets]
- Percentage Boards Correct: [Insert percentage here, e.g. 98.0% - remove brackets]

Noisy data:

- Percentage Squares Correct: [Insert percentage here, e.g. 83.3% - remove brackets]
- Percentage Boards Correct: [Insert percentage here, e.g. 58.1% - remove brackets]
